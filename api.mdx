## Setup

Learn how to create and configure an API key for access to the Developer API.

To create an API key:

    1. From the [ROGER Dashboard](https://app.thanksroger.com), open the
    **Settings** for your workspace from the account menu in the top-right
    corner of the screen.
    1. Click the **API keys** section from the left navigation panel.
    1. Click **Create API key**.
    1. Specify what teams this API can create contracts in.
    1. Click **Create** to confirm and generate an API key.
    1. Copy the API key for your records -- it will not be shown again.

## Authentication

All requests made to the ROGER Developer API must be authenticated with a valid
API key. The API key must be passed in the `Authorization` HTTP header using the
`Bearer` scheme. Below is an example of a header specifying your API key:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Workspace IDs

Most of the Developer API endpoints require specifying your Workspace ID,
usually provided as a parameter `workspaceId` in the endpoint path.

You can find the ID of your workspace in the URL of your ROGER Dashboard.

In the below example, your `workspaceId` would be `wvEOhUlU8rHy5EXAwNn1`:

```
https://app.thanksroger.com/workspaces/wvEOhUlU8rHy5EXAwNn1/contracts
```

## Template IDs

Some of the Developer API endpoints require specifying a Template ID, usually
provided as the value of a property `templateId` in the request body.

You can find the ID of your workspace in the URL of the template's edit screen.

In the below example, your `templateId` would be `E23eipzNxLKe28bYP1FI`:

```
https://app.thanksroger.com/workspaces/wvEOhUlU8rHy5EXAwNn1/templates/E23eipzNxLKe28bYP1FI
```

## Creating a contract from a template

To create a contract from a template, specify the ID of the template to use and
the values of each variable the template requires (without the `@` prefix). The
`createdBy` parameter should be set to an email address of a user from a team
within your workspace.

```
POST https://app.thanksroger.com/api/v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/contracts

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "templateId": "TEMPLATE_ID",
  "templateValues": {
    "Signer name": {
      "type": "singletext",
      "value": "VALUE_AS_STRING"
    },
    "Signer email": {
      "type": "singletext",
      "value": "VALUE_AS_STRING"
    },
    "List of services": {
      "type": "multitext",
      "value": "LINE_1\nLINE_2"
    },
    "Statement of work": {
      "type": "richtext",
      "value": "<ol><li>Step 1</li><li>Step 2</li></ol>"
    }
  },
  "createdBy": "user@yourcompany.com",
  "name": "NEW_CONTRACT_NAME"
}
```

This method will respond with the `workspaceId`, `contractId`, and a
`signingLink`, which can be used to sign the contract.

```
200 OK

{
  "workspaceId": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
  "contractId": "CREATED_CONTRACT_ID",
  "signingLink": "https://app.thanksroger.com/sign/..."
}
```

### Sending the created contract via email

By default, the API method to create a contract (above) will just create the
contract and return to you the signingLink, which you can choose to deliver to
the contract's signers on your own.

If instead, you would like ROGER to share the signing link with the contract's
signers for you, specify the `email` paramter in the request.

The `email` parameter (default `false`) will send the signing link to the
contract's signers if it is either `true` or an object specifying additional
options.

Here are a couple of examples:

```
{
  "templateId": "TEMPLATE_ID",
  "templateValues": { ... },
  "createdBy": "user@yourcompany.com",
  "name": "NEW_CONTRACT_NAME",
  "email": true
}
```

```
{
  "templateId": "TEMPLATE_ID",
  "templateValues": { ... },
  "createdBy": "user@yourcompany.com",
  "name": "NEW_CONTRACT_NAME",
  "email": {
    "logoUrl": "...",
    "subject": "Your signature is requested",
    "message": "Please take a moment to sign this contract"
  }
}
```

If `subject`, or `message` are not specified, the defaults will be used. If
`logoUrl` is not specified, the default for your workspace as configured in your
workspace's settings will be used. If your workspace has a default logo
configured, but you wish to omit the logo in this email, use `null` for
`logoUrl`.

#### Optimizing email deliverability

When using ROGER to send signature request emails, the message will come from
roger@thanksroger.com with the `reply-to` header set to the `createdBy` user. To
maximize deliverability to the recipient's inbox, ROGER uses minimal,
email-compatible HTML that has been tested with email deliverability tools like
Litmus and Unspam. Here are a few other tips to help make sure your emails land
in recipient inboxes:

   - Avoid spammy keywords in the subject or message (e.g. "100% free" or "act
     now").
   - Write a personalized message to help the message get marked as
     private/direct instead of a bulk email.
   - Include the name of the signer in the contract's configuration. In
     addition to just the email address of the signer, also specify the signer's
     full name. It will automatically be used in the email's `to` header.

### Variable types

Variables in ROGER templates are typed. When providing variable values via the
contract creation API, the type of the value must be compatible with the type
of the variable.

Template variable values are specified in the `templateValues` property of the
request body. It is a JSON record mapping from names of template variables to
a typed value object. A typed value object is is a JSON record with a `type`
property. Other properties of the typed value object depend on the type.

#### Variable types:

| Type            | Description                | Value type   |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| `singletext`    | Text (single line)         | `singletext` |
| `multitext`     | Paragraph (multiple lines) | `multitext`  |
| `richtext`      | Rich text (HTML)           | `richtext`   |
| `chooseonetext` | Choose one option          | `singletext` |

#### Typed value objects:

| Type         | Description           | Example                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `singletext` | Text with no newlines | `{ "type": "singletext", "value": "foo" }`                 |
| `multitext`  | Text with newlines    | `{ "type": "multitext", "value": "foo\nbar" }`             |
| `richtext`   | HTML-formatted text   | `{ "type": "richtext", "value": "<ul><li>foo</li></ul>" }` |

### Passing additional information to webhook events

It can be useful to tie additional information to a contract, such as customer
or deal identifiers from your CRM.

For example, you may want to attach an `opportunityId` to a contract you're
programatically creating in response to an opportunity being created in your
HubSpot. Later, when the `contract.signed` event is fired and any configured
webhooks are notified, it is convenient to have the associated `opportunityId`
present in the webhook event body so you can update your CRM object accordingly.

To do this, create another template variable called `@Opportunity ID` -- it's
okay if you don't use the value of this variable to populate any information in
the contract. You can create any number of arbitrary variables in your template
that you can populate via the `templateValues` parameters of the POST request
body. They will be provided in the `submission.values` property of the
`contract.signed` event when the contract is signed.
