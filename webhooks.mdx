## Setup

Learn how to create and configure a webhook.

To create a webhook:

    1. From the [ROGER Dashboard](https://app.thanksroger.com), open the
    **Settings** for your workspace from the account menu in the top-right
    corner of the screen.
    1. Click the **Webhooks** section from the left navigation panel.
    1. Click **Create webhook**.
    1. Enter the URL of the endpoint where you would like to receive JSON
    webhook events, and specify what teams to include contract notifications
    for.
    1. Click **Create** to confirm and generate a webhook secret.

## Handling events

Events are sent to configured webhook URLs via an HTTP POST request with a JSON
body (`application/json`).

### Event authentication

A secret is generated with each webhook endpoint you configure in ROGER. You can
view the secret key for each webhook in the **Webhooks** section of the
**Settings** screen from the [ROGER Dashboard](https://app.thanksroger.com).

To verify that an event delivered to your endpoint truly came from ROGER, two
additional request headers are included in the HTTP POST request:

   * `x-roger-timestamp` - Number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.
   * `x-roger-signature` - HMAC, computed as the SHA-256 digest of the
     concatenation of the X-Roger-Timestamp and the JSON request body
     represented as strings.

Developers should only trust events that have a valid HMAC in the
`x-roger-signature` header.

### Event body

Here is an example JSON body with comments:

```
{
  # Type of webhook event.
  "event": "contract.signed",

  # Name and email address of the signer.
  "signer": {
    "name": "John Hancock",
    "email": "john.hancock@gmail.com"
  },

  # Data submitted by the signer.
  "submission": {

    # Number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.
    "timestamp": 1733367410253,

    # Ordered field values.
    "values": [
      # First field...
      {
        # ID of the field.
        # (Remains stable even if fields are reordered in the template.)
        "id": "BbCoK2kaWKFEkCoQymks",

        # Type of the field.
        "type": "singletext",

        # Value of the field.
        "value": "John Hancock"
      },
      # Second field...
      {
        "id": "BeLMd7tgYUeheQwnMDDe",
        "type": "signature",
        "value": "John Hancock"
      }
    ]

  },

  # This will only be present if the contract was created from a template.
  "template": {
    "variables": [
      {
        "name": "Price",
        "type": "singletext",
        "value": "$1500"
      }
    ]
  },

}
